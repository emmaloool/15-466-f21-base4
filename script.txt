Great news! Remember that company Banana that you applied to a couple weeks ago?
1,Yeah? 
1,No, just tell me?

1 3 2
They thought you're a great fit for their kPhone Software Engineer position!
So they want to schedule you for a final interview! 
When would you like to schedule your interview starting tomorrow?
2,Woah no, that's too soon. I'll need a couple weeks!
3,Sure, I can do it Friday.

3 1 2
Friday is only a couple days a way, that's not too much time to prepare!
4,It's whatever
4,I have 6 homework assignments due next week, I don't have a choice!

4 1 2
How are you going to prepare for the interview?
5,Just wing it
6,LeetCode until dawn

2 1 2
A couple of weeks is plenty enough time to prepare, good choice!
7,Yeah, I'm a bit rusty with C++, so I'll need to review that...
7,Of course, this is my dream job! I need to study a lot!

7 1 3
What are you going to study first?
8,Brush up your elevator pitch
9,Pull up old projects and course notes to review
10,LeetCode for a couple days, just to get comfortable

It's time to start your interview! Let's begin with behavioral questions.
Why are you interested in working for Banana?
21, Uh, uh... who?
22,I've been a big fan of the kPhone since I was a kid!

17 1 1
Oh no! You overslept and missed your interview!
23,[*screams in agony*]

21 1 1
[Oh no! You forgot what Banana does as a company! They are not impressed!]
24,[You probably shouldn't have winged that!]

Now let's move onto a short programming question.
How would you compute the midpoint for binary search indices?
28,#mid = low/2 + hi/2
28,#mid = (hi - lo)/2

Wrong! The answer was:
#mid = low + (hi - lo)/2
You would've known that if you prepared or remembered anything from school!
30,Sad! :(

29 3 1
Wrong! The answer was:
#mid = low + (hi - lo)/2
You probably should have spent more time studying!

That's correct! Now here comes the final question.
What can you do to simulate caustics in rendering?
35,Hm, let me think about this one...
35,I know this! 

33 2 1
That's correct! Now here comes the final question.
What can you do to simulate caustics in rendering?
34,Wow, that's pretty niche...

34 1 1
So do you know the answer?
36,Sadly, no...

35 1 3
You do? What's the technique you can use to replicate caustics?
36,Just some simple inverse kinematics?
38,You can use a texture to simulating the rippling effect!
38,You can implement photon mapping!

36 1 1
No, that was wrong. Maybe you should've paid attention more in 15-462!
37,Oh well...
